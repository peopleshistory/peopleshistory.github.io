        <h1>Season One: The Point</h1><hr/><h3>Rebellion and Resistance in Boston Public Housing</h3><br/>

        <h4>Coming November 14, A People’s History is a new documentary podcast series from <i>Jacobin</i>, with support from the Economic Hardship Reporting Project.<br/><br/>Inspired by Howard Zinn’s A People’s History of the United States, the podcast focuses on several important events in working-class history. Our first season traces a social history of Boston from the urban rebellions of the 1960s through busing in the 70s.<br/><br/>

We have decided to tell these moments through the lens of one community: Columbia Point, the largest public housing project in New England. Built on an isolated landfill site next to the Boston city dump, it was the site of major organizing, from Welfare Rights to a Free Breakfast program. It was also the first public housing project to be sold off and redeveloped as private "mixed-income" development (and was a model for the federal policy "HOPE VI").<br/><br/>

Featuring new music from Marisa Anderson, Liz Harris, and Ilyas Ahmed, this is the untold story of the tenant struggles in and around Boston public housing. It’s a story about regular people—mainly Black mothers—standing up to the mayor’s office, organizing sit-ins to get the services they were owed, fighting evictions, and creating their own power. </h4><br/><br/>    <h3 style="color:red;">Season one, episode one coming November 14</h3> </div>

      <!-- READINGS -->

      <div id="readings-panel" class="panel"><h1>Reading Series</h1><hr/><h3>A People's Anthology</h3><br/>
        <h4>In collaboration with <i>Boston Review</i>, we’re creating a series of texts and speeches to supplement the main podcast called <b>A People’s Anthology</b>. Our first season brings together key primary sources relating to urban rebellions, from Claudia Jones to the Combahee River Collective, introduced by radical scholars such as Nikhil Pal Singh and Jackie Wang.<br/> 
<br/>We don’t believe in eternal paywalls, so A People’s Anthology will become publicly available some time next year — but for now only our Patreon supporters and <a href="https://store.bostonreview.net/memberships" target="blank"><i>Boston Review</i> members</a> will get access to this pod! </h4>
