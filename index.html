              People's History is an independent radio series that examines the past
              from the perspective of the working class.<br /><br />
              Our first season, The Point, traces a social history of Boston from
              the urban rebellions of the 1960s, through busing in the 70s, into the
              Clinton era.<br /><br />
              We investigate these events from the lens of one community:
              Columbia Point, the largest public housing project in New England.
              Built on an isolated landfill site next to the Boston city dump,
              it was the site of major organizing, from welfare rights to a Free
              Breakfast for Children program. It was also the first federal public
              housing project to be sold off and redeveloped as private
              "mixed-income" development (and was a model for the federal policy
              "HOPE VI").<br /><br />
              This is the untold story of the tenant struggles in and around
              Boston public housing. It’s a story about working people—mainly
              black mothers—standing up to the mayor’s office, organizing
              sit-ins to get the services they were owed, fighting evictions,
              and creating their own power.
